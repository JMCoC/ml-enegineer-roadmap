#Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function 
#from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation 
#of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with 
# that a particular action will be performed, but donâ€™t need to know 
#how the action will be performed.

#Abstraction can be achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.
#Python does not have abstract classes and interfaces like other
#object-oriented languages, but we can achieve abstraction using
#the abc module.

#Abstraction classes
#Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods
#with no implementation.

#Abstract method: A method that is declared, but contains no implementation.
# Concrete method: A method that is declared with implementation.
